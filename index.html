          Superman was born on the fictional planet Krypton and was named
          Kal-El. As a baby, his parents sent him to Earth in a small spaceship
          moments before Krypton was destroyed in a natural cataclysm. His ship
          landed in the American countryside, near the fictional town of
          Smallville. He was found and adopted by farmers Jonathan and Martha
          Kent, who named him Clark Kent. Clark developed various superhuman
          abilities, such as incredible strength and impervious skin. His
          adoptive parents advised him to use his abilities for the benefit of
          humanity, and he decided to fight crime. To protect his personal life,
          he changes into a colorful costume and uses the alias "Superman" when
          fighting crime. In this public image, he is
